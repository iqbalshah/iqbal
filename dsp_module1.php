Introduction</b></td></tr><tr><td>

Welcome to a Boot Camp for Software Testers. This course is a foundation course in IT software testing concepts. It provides an excellent overview of the entire IT software testing professional area. It further provides a macro introduction of the software testing area by introducing and reviewing the principles expounded by leading testing experts. Areas covered by this course include roles and responsibilities, test techniques, test planning and the different types of testing commonly performed. This course similarly provides an exceptional review for those planning to pursue IT software testing certification for the Certified Software Test Engineer (CSTE) professional designation.
Included in this module is a Self-Assessment you can perform on your organization. This is a full version of a Self-Assessment to help you and your company establish a baseline in your testing environment.

Discussion 1: Are you doing the best job you can in testing? What is inhibiting you from doing this? List as many things as you can that is inhibiting you from doing the best job you can. Explain why you chose each one of the items.
</td></tr><tr><td>
In this module you will learn some of the basics about quality and how to manage quality in the ever changing world we are in.
Most individuals cannot tell the difference between quality assurance (QA) and quality control (QC). A majority of quality assurance groups, in fact, practice quality control. This module will teach you the primary difference between quality assurance and quality control and how to recognize QA practices from QC. You will also learn how to understand the culture in which you may have to manage quality. The very first step is to identify what quality means to your organization.

The mission of the Quality Assurance Institute (QAI) is to help transition information technology organizations into world-class "IT" organizations.

Figure 1-Learning Cycle
</td></tr><tr><td>
QAI does this by collecting, summarizing and generalizing the best work practices of the approximately one thousand-plus IT affiliated organizations and then making those best practices available to QAI member organizations. QAI uses membership synonymous with a partnership to help its members continuously improve into world-class IT organizations.

Figure 1-Learning Cycle
QAI uses a learning cycle (Figure 1) to build best-of-the-best IT work practices. This learning cycle commences when QAI collects the lessons learned from its affiliated organizations. Member organizations may spend many thousands of dollars developing these work practices but are willing to share them because they are noncompetitive aspects of their organizations. The QAI professional staff collects many best-practices on the same topic and then summarizes, standardizes in a common format, and distributes them to member organizations through QAI's Process WarehouseSM. The member organizations utilize those best-practices into day-to-day operations. From member feedback and QAI's professional staff on-site to support member organizations, improvements to those work practices are identified. These improvements are then incorporated into the practices until they truly become best-of-the-best IT work practic

Critical Success Factors
</b></td></tr><tr><td>
There are four critical success factors that make it possible to successfully implement work practices in an IT organization. The success factors listed below contribute to those work processes are:
<br>·	Committed management
<br>·	A skilled staff
<br>·	Effective work processes
<br>·	Continuous improvement<br>
In the following units we will look at these success factors individually


</td></tr><tr><td><b>
Committed Management
</b></td></tr><tr><td>
Of the four critical success factors, a committed management is the most important. A management committed to becoming a world-class organization is one that not only preaches that objective, but also is personally involved in making sure a quality environment exists. A committed management rewards workers for performing quality work as opposed to meeting schedules and being politically savvy. A committed management enforces the use of work processes and a committed management invests in their staff so the staff is competent in using the assigned work processes.
</td></tr><tr><td><b>
Relationship of Management to Work Processes
</b></td></tr><tr><td>
There are two categories of work processes in every IT organization; these are the management processes and the work processes. Management work processes include such things as strategic planning, setting goals, monitoring progress, and motivating the staff. The detailed work processes might include:
<br>·	Coding
<br>·	Documenting
<br>·	Building databases
<br>·	Software testing
Experience has shown that if the management processes are not in place, workers will not follow the work processes. For example, if management has not established security policies, and doesn't reward good security practices etc., workers will not be concerned about protecting passwords and identifying potential penetration activities.

</td></tr><tr><td><b>
A Skilled Staff
</b></td></tr><tr><td>
Work processes will not be used effectively unless the staff is adequately trained in how to use those processes. The newer performance appraisal methods evaluate staff on both their skill level and the results that they perform. The mastery of skills, plus the performance results achieved from a worker, determines the performance appraisal and salary increases.
</td></tr><tr><td><b>
Quality Skills Emphasis
</b></td></tr><tr><td>
There are two categories of quality skills that all IT staff needs to acquire. These are the preventive skills that enable a worker to do a task and the detective skills that enable workers to identify errors and omissions should they occur. QAI has professional certifications in both preventive and detective skills. The Certified Software Quality Analyst certification is for those who are skilled in building an environment in which quality flourishes - meaning doing the job right the first time. QAI also administers a professional certification for those skilled in checking to ensure the work is done correctly - the Certified Software Test Engineer certification.

</td></tr><tr><td><b>
Using Work Processes Effectively
</b></td></tr><tr><td>
Using work practices alone does not ensure high quality, high productivity, and customer satisfaction. IT organizations need an approach for effectively using work practices. There are four concepts QAI believes are essential to using work practices effectively.
These are:
<br>1.	the work practices must support the IT vision and mission;
<br>2.	the work practices must be incorporated into an integrated approach;
<br>3.	the work practices must be supported by detailed "how-to" work and check procedures; and
<br>4.	the process must be in place to mature the work practices. We will discuss each of these four factors individually.
</td></tr><tr><td><b>
Generally Accepted Quality Models
</b></td></tr><tr><td>
There are several generally accepted quality models. These models illustrate what they believe is an organization performing at a world-class level. In other words, the models tell you "what" to do, but not necessarily how to do it. At QAI, we believe quality models are equivalent to a vision statement because they are strategic and not practical. The three best accepted quality models are:
<br>·	The International Organization of Standards
<br>·	The Software Engineering Institute Capability Maturity Model
<br>·	The Malcolm Baldrige Quality Model.
All of these models are generic and may not be the right approach for any specific organization. Therefore the model, or vision, must be modified so that it
supports the IT mission
</td></tr><tr><td><img src="images\approach.gif" width=60%></td></tr><tr><td><b>

QAI Implementation Approach
</b></td></tr><tr><td>
<p>Generally, work practices are ineffective if they are isolated from other work practices. The common example of this in IT is project estimates that are developed from a work practice separate from the practices used to build software. Thus, the estimate may not take into account all of the procedures the IT staff must follow in building quality software. If those work practices were integrated, the estimate would be representative of the effort actually required to follow the practices to build software.
QAI recognizes that IT organizations must evolve their own vision statement - their own mission. The generally accepted quality models can be helpful in accomplishing that objective; however, the quality models do not explain how to implement the models. Thus, QAI's Implementation Approach (Figure 2), which is integrated, can be used to implement any of the generally accepted quality models, or a uniquely developed vision statement for a specific IT organization.
</p><p>The QAI Implementation Approach incorporates all of the components needed to effectively operate an IT organization, beginning with customer needs - in other words, the statements of work for IT to accomplish. IT management then becomes the driver in assuring those needs are satisfied within the customer's time, budget, and quality constraints. IT management becomes responsible for shaping customer expectations. IT management must also establish the methods that will be used to satisfy those needs. These methods include the human resources function which controls staffing and training; the quality assurance function which oversees the creation of a quality environment, including the building of the work processes, although quality assurance itself does not build the work processes; the quality control function which checks to ensure quality exists; the suppliers of products and services to the IT organization, such as hardware, off-the-shelf software and training; the product development group which acquires, builds, maintains the software; and the product delivery function which delivers the products and services to the customer. </p><p>These deliverables produced from the methods or work processes must be measured against the customer's and IT management's expected results. If the measurements show that the work processes are not performing correctly, or the customer needs are not being performed correctly, rework must occur or customer requirements changed, to assure customer satisfaction. The goal of this integrated approach is customer satisfaction.

If this implementation approach looks complex, it's because it is complex. It is not an easy task to integrate the totality of the work processes needed to satisfy customers. Unfortunately, the failure to do that results in missed work schedules, exorbitant costs and customer dissatisfaction. It has been estimated that the average IT organization spends half of their total project budget on identifying and correcting problems due to ineffective use of work practices. This integrated implementation approach offers the opportunity to dramatically reduce costs and significantly improve customer satisfaction without the use of additional investment in technology. Using a quality cliché, it happens from doing the right job and doing that job right the first time.
</td></tr><tr><td><b>
QAI Best Practices Seminars
</b></td></tr><tr><td>
QAI's educational seminars are designed to support QAI's implementation approach. While a specific seminar such as Effective Methods of Software Testing, focuses on the quality control component of the QAI implementation approach, it is designed to integrate with the other QAI seminars such as the Measurement seminar.
It is important to note that when you attend a specific QAI seminar, you must consider the total environment in which you work. Again, if you're building a test process it should be integrated into the process designed to build software. QAI's seminar on process engineering, which teaches how to build work processes, also teaches the integration of multiple work practices and how to achieve that integration.
QAI's seminars are of two types. Some are identified as "boot camps." These are seminars designed to teach you the skill sets necessary to perform within one or more of the nine process categories included in QAI's Implementation Approach. The other types of seminars are those designed to teach specific work processes. While the boot camps focus on what you should do, the process courses teach you how to do it. For example, the Boot Camp for Testers teaches basic testing skills while the Effective Methods for Software Testing seminar teaches how to develop test plans and implement those plans.
</td></tr><tr><td><b>
Maturing Work Practices
</b></td></tr><tr><td>
Once in place, work practices need to be improved. Generally, you do not improve a single work practice without taking into consideration other related work practices. This requires workbenches, which clearly define all inputs and outputs to each work practice. All work practices need to be continuously improved. Most importantly, because IT management is the driver, the effectiveness of work practices is limited by management's culture. Thus, to make any significant gains requires changing the culture.
Continuous Improvement
Continuous improvement is not a complex process; it is generally done by identifying the defects occurring in the day-to-day performance of a work practice. The defects may be due to lack of skills by the work practice users, or poorly designed or ineffective work practices. Once the defects are identified, they need to be ranked. The highest ranked defect - the one causing the most difficulty in meeting customer needs - is the one that should drive changes to the work process. The objective of continuous improvement is to reduce the defect rate from the work process.

The adoption of a continuous improvement methodology that uses documented information technology processes to deliver a high level of quality and productivity through process repeatability. It is further defined as combining the best industry practices of software quality with the ability to apply these time-tested methods in a rapid and ever-changing paradigm. Focusing on collaboration between developer, customer, management, project leader, and tester, software quality becomes the foundation for the development process rather than an "add-on" as is the case in many organizations.

Testing product from onset, not tested in at the end of the development cycle.<br>

The process of testing software in a dynamic environment whereby the program is executing while testing is underway to identify defects and enhance improved quality and productivity. The methodology combines the best practices of traditional software testing methods and processes with the ability to apply these time-tested methods in a rapid development paradigm. It focuses on collaboration between developer, customer, and tester, testing is accomplished in shorter timeframes with an emphasis on developing the software correctly the first time, thereby eliminating the need for lengthy test cycles and redundant tests. This is a highly customizable approach to testing software and is adaptable to any software development environment. The best success is achieved in organizations that already have mature development and testing processes and have attained a level of capability beyond simplistic means.
The use of work practices will be limited by the specific culture in your IT organization.</p><p> QAI has identified the five most common cultures (Figure 3) in IT organizations worldwide. The first is a culture in which people are managed. This is generally known as "management by objective." The staff is given specific objectives to accomplish, management's concern is that those objectives are accomplished, but management is unconcerned about how those objectives are accomplished.
The second culture manages by work processes. The movement from the managing people culture to the manage-by-process culture is significant. In the manage-people culture people are held responsible for results. In the management by process culture, management is held responsible for results because they provide the work processes that people follow. If the work process cannot produce the proper results, then management is accountable because they are responsible for those work processes.
The third culture manages competencies. This means that the hiring and training of people is focused on making them competent in using the organization's work practices. Also, IT organizations do not accept work that is outside their areas of competency.
The fourth culture manages by fact. </p><p> Quantitative results are established and measures are collected and compared against expected results. Based on those measures, management makes whatever changes are needed in order to assure that the outcome of the work processes are those needed by IT customers.
The fifth culture is one of business innovation. Innovation is possible because at level four, management is confident that they can do what they say with the resources they estimate, and it can be completed within or ahead of schedule. The types of improvements now possible are sometimes called "breakthrough" improvements, meaning significantly new ways to do work. Also in this culture the focus is on using technology to drive business objectives.
The five cultures are generally additive. In other words, when an organization moves to a culture of management-by-process, they do not stop managing people. When they move to the manage-by- competency culture, they are addressing the people issue of work processes. Measurement is not effective until the work processes are stabilized at the manage-by-competency level.
QAI's Boot Camp seminars are focused on the manage-by-people culture. This is because it is difficult to use work processes until people have achieved certain skill levels. Since most IT organizations use the manage-by-people culture, boot camps are very appropriate. As IT organizations begin to move to the manage-by-process level, the QAI process seminars become appropriate and valuable in effectively managing at that level.

Three Simple Steps
</b></td></tr><tr><td>
Successful IT organizations follow three simple steps in becoming world-class. First, they know what they want to be when they mature as an IT organization. This is the vision, or the model, they have chosen to emulate. Second, they know where they are - this is an assessment of their current capabilities and competencies. We have discussed five different IT cultures. Knowing what culture you are in is part of this assessment process. Another part of the assessment process, is to assess your capabilities in each of the nine process categories in QAI's Implementation Approach. Within QAI's Process WarehouseSM are some assessment approaches that can be used or QAI's professional staff is available to perform an assessment for you. The third step is determining how you're going to get from where you are to where you want to be. This is the objective of QAI's Implementation Approach. In doing this, QAI offers you the approach, the Process WarehouseSM of Best Practices, a series of seminars to teach you the skill sets and processes for the nine process categories, and QAI's professional staff stands ready to support you.

What is Testing?
</b></td></tr><tr><td>
Testing is an unnecessary and unproductive activity if its sole purpose is to validate that the specifications were implemented as written. If the developmental processes for software work correctly, they would implement those specifications as written. Thus testing, as performed in most organizations, is a process designed to compensate for an ineffective software development process.
It is risky to develop software and not test it. As long as the developmental and maintenance processes that organizations utilize continue to introduce defects into software, testing will be a very important component. Few users would have confidence in the software delivered if its functions were not validated.
Balancing the organizational dependence on testing with the pressures of delivering software as quickly as possible means that the test process must be designed to provide as much value as possible in the time available. This can be accomplished by using tests to reduce business risk. This includes testing that specifications are implemented as documented, that documented specifications are what the business needs, that the software and its associated manual procedures provide adequate assurance, and that the associated business risks are reduced to an acceptable level.
There has been extensive research on the methods of testing as well as testing tools and techniques.</p><p> The concept of testing has grown from an after-programming evaluation process to a concept that is an integral part of each phase of the system development life cycle. Testing is no longer an adjunct to the system development life cycle (SDLC), but rather is a key part of it. There is no real "shortcut" to a sound testing philosophy, but the highest payback comes from detecting problems early in the SDLC in order to avoid designing and coding the system incorrectly, and then later correcting those defects. Results reported by those organizations using life cycle testing indicate that while the test cost increases, the net cost to develop the system decreases significantly.
Currently, developers spend more time debugging than actually testing. The objective of life cycle testing is to spend more effort testing right from the start of the project, and less time debugging in the coding and testing phases of development. To effectively incorporate testing into the software development process, management must remove the misconceptions and resistance surrounding testing. Some of these misconceptions include:
Testing identifies errors, and therefore appears to place the blame for those errors on the development organization. This attitude can lead to the "us versus them" attitude among the groups who develop software and those responsible for testing it. Anyone can test and no particular set of skills is required. Testers can test for quality at the end of a development pr

The Role of Software Testing
</b></td></tr><tr><td>
What is the primary role of software testing? The answer is two-fold:
<br>·	Determine whether the system meets specifications (producer view)
<br>·	Determine whether the system meets business and user needs (customer view)
In addition, there are several secondary roles for testing in an organization that include:
<br>·	Raising issues
<br>·	Instilling confidence in the system
<br>	Providing insight into the software delivery process
<br>·	Continuously improving the test process
The most common testing challenges deal with requirements and cultural issues. According to a study conducted by the General Accounting Office, the most common software system problems include designing software with incomplete or erroneous decision-making criteria, failing to program the software as intended by the user, and omitting the needed edit checks for determining completeness of input data. Among the most common problems identified by QAI's testing survey participants over the past years are incomplete, ambiguous, and wrong requirements, code logic errors, and error handling difficulties.
The challenges listed below need to be considered as you work to define test practices and the testing process.
<br>·	Testing is not essential for delivery - Testing should be performed on all systems before they are delivered. However, it is possible to skip testing and deliver a faulty product.
<br>·	Testing is often unstructured, ill defined, and therefore, subjective - People can spend significant amounts of time performing testing and have little to show for it unless it is planned to support defined test objectives.
<br>·	Testing is often not "managed" - Without someone in charge of testing, everyone goes his or her own direction. There should be a visible leader to set testing standards, acquire tools, and monitor the testing process.
<br>·	Testing itself is error-prone - There is always a chance you will miss a test case, or that you will misinterpret a requirement when designing a test. Automation helps, but errors can still be made during testing.
<br>·	Testing is expensive - Testing takes time, people, and tools. On some projects, the cost of testing equals or exceeds the cost of development. The goal is to test smarter, not longer.
You can't test quality into software - Testing will not improve bad coding techniques or poor coding structure.
</td></tr><tr><td><b>
Test Practices and Process
</b></td></tr><tr><td>
Testing is a key component of the software development process. Like all processes, the software development process follows a cycle compromised of the following four components:
<br>·	Plan - Devise a plan
<br>·	Do - Execute the plan
<br>·	Check - Check the results
<br>·	Action - Take the necessary action<br>
Testing activities are the core of the check component of the plan-do-check-act (PDCA) cycle. The software project team is responsible for the three remaining components. The project team plans the project, builds the software (i.e., 'do' component); the testers check to determine that the software meets the needs of the customer and users. If it does not, the testers report defects to the development team. It is the project team that makes the determination as to whether the uncovered defects are to be corrected or not.
The role of testing is to fulfill the check responsibilities assigned to the testers; it is not to determine whether software can be placed into production. That is the responsibility of the customer, user, and project team.
Defects
The purpose of testing is to uncover defects. A defect is a variance from a desired product attribute. There are two categories of defects:
<br>·	Variance from product specifications - The product built varies from the product specified. For example, the specifications may say that a is to be added to b to produce c. If the algorithm in the built product varies from that specification, it is considered to be defective.
<br>·	Variance from customer/user expectation - This variance is something that the user wanted that is not in the built product, but also was not specified to be included in the built product. The missing piece may be a specification or requirement, or the method by which the requirement was implemented may be unsatisfactory.
Defects generally fall into one of the following three categories:
<br>·	Wrong - The specifications have been implemented incorrectly. This defect is a variance from customer/user specification.
<br>·	Missing - A specified or wanted requirement is not in the built product. This can be a variance from specification, an indication that the specification was not implemented, or a requirement of the customer identified during or after the product was built.
<br>·	Extra - A requirement incorporated into the product that was not specified. This is always a variance from specifications, but may be an attribute desired by the user of the product. However, it is considered a defect.
A defect can be found within the software itself or in the supporting documentation. While the defect is a flaw in the software system, it has no impact until it affects the customer/user and the operation of the system. A defect that causes an error in operation or negatively impacts a user/customer is called a failure. The main concern with defects is that they will turn into failures. It is the failure that damages the organization. Some defects never turn into failures. On the other hand, a single defect can cause millions of failures. For example, a software defect that disrupts one million phone calls is one that causes one million failures.
</td></tr><tr><td>
Discussion 3: How does your company currently log defects? Explain to the best of your knowledge what happens when a defect is first identified.
</td></tr><tr><td><b>
Process Problems and Defect Rates
</b></td></tr><tr><td>
Processes that do not work properly cause most defects. For example, if the requirements process is flawed, the user of that process will not gather the proper information. If the training process taught a programmer that the ADD command would cause subtraction to occur, the programmer would write a defective line of code every time the ADD command was used.
In his book, Out of Crisis, Dr. W. Edwards Deming frequently stated that at least 90 percent of all defects are caused by process problems. Evidence from leading corporations has proved Dr. Deming to be correct. This is significant to the tester, because it makes the tester aware that any time a process is used, defects of approximately the same type and frequency will occur. For example, experience has shown that approximately 60 percent of software defects originate in the requirements phase of the project. This is because the process was not effective in gathering all of the customer needs during that phase of software development. The implication is that testers should focus the majority of their efforts on looking for missing or wrong requirements.
Developers of sophisticated commercial software have used this premise in defining defect expectations. Through experience they determined, for example, that there should be 30 defects per thousand lines of code uncovered during testing. </p><p>If testing does not uncover the 30 defects, a logical conclusion is that the test process was not effective. Thus, in some commercial software development organizations the software will be retested because of the very high probability that the first test effort did not uncover all of the defects. In most instances the extra tests validate the assumption that more defects were present.
The number of defects produced in building software will depend on the maturity of the process. Maturity meaning how much variability is permitted in the process. For example, the more that system developers can deviate from the defined process, the greater the variability.
Using the software development process that exists in approximately 90 percent of all information services groups (i.e., those generally considered to be immature processes or processes with great variability), one can expect approximately 60 defects per thousand lines of source code to be created during development. As the processes mature, these defect rates decrease.
In production, for immature processes, defect rates of six defects per thousand lines of source code are not unusual. Until recently, leading commercial software developers were producing software with production defect rates of one defect per thousand lines of source code. Today, leading software developers are producing production code with defect rates of approximately one defect per 30,000 lines of source code.

A "Risk" Perspective for Testing
</b></td></tr><tr><td>
Senior executives use the PDCA cycle or similar tools to develop their corporate strategy. Strategic plans are converted into business initiatives. The plan-do components of the PDCA cycle are easy to understand. From a senior executive's perspective, the check component is one that must address business risk.
Risk is the probability that undesirable events will occur. These undesirable events will prevent the organization from successfully implementing its business initiatives. For example, there is the risk that the information used in making business decisions will be incorrect or late. If the risk turns into reality and the information is late or incorrect, an erroneous business decision may cause a failed business initiative.
Controls are the means used by organizations to minimize risk. Software testing is a control. It can assist in eliminating or minimizing risks, such as information arriving late or being produced in an incorrect manner. Thus, senior executives rely on controls such as software testing to assist them in fulfilling their business objectives.
</p><p>The purpose of controls, such as software testing, is to provide information to management so they can better react to risk situations. For example, testing may indicate that the system will be late, or there is a low probability that the information produced will be correct. Knowing this information, management can then make decisions to minimize that risk: Knowing that the project may be late, they could assign additional personnel to speed up the software development effort.
Testers must understand that their business role is to evaluate business risk and to report those results to management. Viewed from this perspective, testers must first ensure they understand the business risk, and then develop test strategies focused on those risks. The highest business risk should receive the most test resources, while the lowest business risk should receive the least amount of resources. This way, the testers are assured that they are focusing on what is important to their management.

The People Challenges
</b></td></tr><tr><td>
Organizations are finally becoming convinced that testers truly CANNOT test in quality at the end of the development process and that the traditional waterfall methodology has lead to many of the issues that surround testing today. We now understand that testing has typically not been well defined and leaving it as the last activity in the development process was not the best approach.
</td></tr><tr><td><img src="images\waterfall.gif"></td></tr><tr><td>
The word "testing" conjures up a variety of meanings depending upon an individual's frame of reference. Some people view testing as a method or process by which they add value to the development cycle. They can even enjoy the challenges and creativity of testing. Other's feel that testing tries a person's qualities like patience, fairness, ambition, credibility, and capability. Testing can actually affect a person's mental and emotional health if you consider the office politics and interpersonal conflicts that are often times present.
Some of the attitudes that have helped shape a negative view of testing and testers are:
<br>·	Testers hold up implementation
<br>·	Giving testers less time to test will reduce the chance that they will find defects
<br>·	Letting the testers find problems is an appropriate way to debug
<br>·	Defects found in production are the fault of the testers
<br>·	Testers do not need any training, only programmers do<br>
Although testing is a process, it is very much a dynamic one in that the process will change somewhat with each application under test. There are several variables that affect the testing process including: the development process itself, software risk, customer/user participation, the testing process, a tester's skillset, use of tools, testing budget and resource constraints, management support, and morale and motivation of the testers. It is obvious that the people side of software testing has long been ignored for the more process-related issues of test planning, test tools, defect tracking, and so on.
According to the book Surviving the Top Ten Challenges of Software Testing, A People-Oriented Approach by William Perry and Randall Rice, ten top people challenges have been identified. The challenges which will be discussed in more detal later in the course are:

<br>·	Relationship building with developers
<br>·	Using tools
<br>.	Getting managers to understand testing
<br>·	Communicating with users about testing
<br>·	Making the necessary time for testing
<br>·	Testing "over the wall" software
<br>·	Trying to hit a moving target
<br>·	Fighting a lose-lose situation
<br>·	Having to say no
Testers should perform a self-assessment in order to identify their own strengths and weaknesses as they relate to technical and people-oriented skills, they should learn how to improve their identified weaknesses, and finally, build a master plan of action for future improvement.
Essential testing skills include test planning, using test tools (automated and manual), executing tests, managing defects, risk analysis, test measurement, designing a test environment, and designing effective test cases. Additionally, a solid vocabulary of testing is essential. Essentially a tester needs to understand what to test, who performs what type of test, when testing should be performed, how to actually perform the test, and when to stop testing.

The Importance of Testing
</b></td></tr><tr><td>
Another important part of a tester's responsibility might be to raise management's awareness of the issues surrounding testing. Depending on the tester's position within the organization this task could prove to be quite challenging. There are several steps that a tester can take to accomplish this:
<br>·	Calculate how much testing costs your organization and ensure that these costs are understood by management
<br>·	Show management ways that the testing costs can be reduced by using more effective techniques
<br>·	Relay other benefits of testing-like shorter test times and higher quality software
<br>·	Show that testing training is built into your own personal goals and objectives, and discuss your training needs with your immediate boss
<br>·	Collect and distribute articles about testing
<br>·	Inquire about the budget for testing
<br>·	Use creative means to enlighten management
</td></tr><tr><td><b>
Types of Test Training
</b></td></tr><tr><td>
There are many ways a tester can improve his or her skillset, including attending seminars and conferences, taking self-study and vendor supplied courses, reading books and viewing videos, and participating in or developing in-house courses on testing subject matter.
Suppose management does not support testing training? Testers should pursue their long-term goals for testing skills improvement since the current situation may change or they may make a career move to another organization that values testing skills more than the previous employer. Even if budget for testing training does not exist, a tester can take advantage of networking and attending local presentations sponsored by vendors and professional organizations, or by utilizing the Internet or local libraries for information.
Testing improvement involves change and in turn, change involves a degree of risk. In fact, there are two ways to view this risk: the risk of failure and the risk of not improving. </p><p>The bottom line is that doing what doesn't work won't make it work any better. Taking stock of the current test process and formulating short and long term improvement plans is essential for the overall enhancement of the organization's test effort and the tester's professional development.
Continuous Improvement in the Testing Process
Process improvement is best considered as a continuous process, where the organization moves continually around an improvement cycle. Within this cycle, improvement is accomplished in a series of steps or specific actions. An important step in the improvement cycle is the execution of some form of data gathering to establish the initial state, and subsequently to confirm the improvements.</p><p> A testing process assessment is one excellent way to determine the status of your current test process.
Assessment is the thoughtful analysis of testing results, and then taking corrective action on the identified weaknesses.
Testing process assessment is a means of capturing information describing the current capability of an organization's test process. Assessment is an activity that is performed either during an improvement initiative or as part of a capability determination. In either case, the formal entry to the process occurs with the compilation of the assessment input, which defines the purpose (why it is being carried out), the scope (which processes are being assessed), what constraints (if any) apply and any additional information that needs to be gathered. The input also defines the responsibility for carrying out the assessment.
Process assessment is undertaken to measure organizational current processes. An assessment may be conducted as a self-assessment, an assisted self-assessment, or an independent assessment. The assessment may be discrete or continuous. A team with or without the aid of tool support typically carries out a discrete assessment manually. A continuous assessment may use manual methods or automated tools for a data collection.</p><p> Whatever form of assessment is used, a qualified assessor who has the competencies required oversees the assessment.
An assessment is carried out by assessing selected processes against a compatible model of good engineering practice created from, or mapped to, the defined reference model. The reference model defines processes characterized by statements of purpose, and attributes that apply across all processes. The process attributes are grouped into process capability levels that define an ordinal scale of capability.
The assessment output consists of a set of attribute ratings for each process instance assessed, and may also include the capability level achieved. Process assessment is applicable in the following circumstances:
<br>·	Understanding the state of processes for improvement
<br>·	Determining the suitability of processes for a particular requirement or class of requirements
<br>·	Determining the suitability of another organization's processes for a particular contract or class of contracts

The framework for process assessment:
</b></td></tr><tr><td>
<br>·	Encourages self-assessment
<br>·	Takes into account the context in which the assessed process operate
<br>·	Produces a set of process ratings (a process profile) rather than a pass/fail result
<br>·	Addresses the adequacy of the management of the assessed processes through generic practices
Is appropriate across all application categories and sizes of organization
The sophistication and complexity required of a process is dependent upon its context. This influences how a qualified assessor judges a practice when assessing its adequacy, and influences the degree of comparability between process profiles.
Within a process improvement context, assessment provides the means of characterizing the current practice within an organizational unit in terms of capability. Analysis of the results in the light of business needs identifies strengths, weaknesses, and risks inherent in the processes. This, in turn, leads to the ability to determine whether the processes are effective in achieving their goals and to identify significant causes of poor quality or overruns in time or cost.</p><p> These provide the drivers for prioritizing improvements to processes.
One of the most commonly identified weaknesses in software testing has been the lack of facts (metrics), and without facts there is no reason to take action (improvement). Once appropriate measures are identified, tracked, and analyzed, then a plan for continuous improvement can be implemented.
It is important to understand that the concept of measurement first and action second, is most effective when the measures are very specific. Measurement must be able to determine the effect of the actions. For example, the metric approach fulfills this requirement in that it shows very specific relationships. Using this concept, if action is taken by changing one of the metric variables, the result of that action can be quickly measured.
Changing the variable in one metric can usually be measured by the changes to another metric. </p><p>As another example, if the number of defects detected after the system goes into production is higher than expected or desirable, then appropriate and timely action should be taken. That action might be to increase the number of test steps. Obviously, this will increase testing costs with the objective of improving the quality of the product by reducing defects. If, after analysis, it is demonstrated that increasing the emphasis on test steps has had the desirable effect, then these additional steps should be incorporated into the normal testing process.
If the opposite is true, then the action did not produce the desired effect and the time and resources spent were less than effective and the actions should be discontinued and another attempted. The process continues until the appropriate and effective improvement mechanisms are uncovered and included in the normal process.

To Navigate to each step choose from the following list:</b><br>
A generic spiral model is the basis of every process improvement program and optimization campaign. This generic spiral model has essentially eight steps:
</td></tr><tr><td><b>
Step 1 - Examine the Organization's Needs and Business Goals
</b></td></tr><tr><td>
A process improvement program start with the recognition of the organization's needs and business goals, usually based on the main drivers and stimuli identified. From an analysis of the organizations needs and existing stimuli for improvement, the objectives of process improvement are identified and described. The final stage of the preliminary definition of the goals for the improvement program is setting the priorities of the process improvement objectives.
Once the analysis of the organization's needs and business goals has been completed, it is essential to build executive awareness of the necessity for a process improvement program. This requires both managerial and financial commitments.
The objectives of such a process improvement program should be clearly stated, understood, and expressed using measurable process goals. The process improvement program should form part of the organizations overall strategic business plan.
</td></tr><tr><td><b>
Step 2 - Conduct Assessment
</b></td></tr><tr><td>
The assessment should be conducted according to a documented process. Assessors must have access to appropriate guidance on how to conduct the assessment and the necessary competence to use the tools.
Each process is assessed by detailed examination. A rating is assigned and validated for each process attribute assessed. In order to provide the basis for repeatability across assessments, the defined set of indicators are used during the assessment to support the assessors' judgment in rating process attributes.
Objective evidence based on the indicators that support the assessors' judgment of the ratings are recorded and maintained to provide the basis for verification of the ratings.
</td></tr><tr><td><b>
Step 3 - Initiate Process Improvement
</b></td></tr><tr><td>
The process improvement program is a project in its own right, and planned and managed accordingly. A plan should be produced at the beginning of the program and subsequently used to monitor progress. The plan should include the relevant background, history, and the current status, if possible expressed in specific numerical terms. The input derived from the organization's needs and business goals provide the main requirements for the plan.
The plan should include a preliminary identification of the scope in terms of the boundaries for the program and the processes to be improved. The plan should cover all the process improvement steps, although initially it may give only outline indications of the later stages. It is important to ensure that key roles are clearly identified, adequate resources allocated, appropriate milestones and review points established, and all risks are identified and documented in the plan. The plan should also include activities to keep all those affected by the improvement informed of progress.
</td></tr><tr><td><b>
Step 4 - Analyze Assessment Output and Derive Action Plan
</b></td></tr><tr><td>
Information collected during the assessment, in particular the capability level ratings, the generic practice ratings, and the base practice ratings, is first analyzed, and a plan of action is derived. This consists of the following activities:
<br>·	Identify and prioritize improvement areas
<br>·	Analyze assessment results. Analysis of the results provides information about the variability as well as current strengths and weaknesses and indicates opportunities for improvement
<br>·	Analyze the organization's needs and improvement goals. The processes and their relationships are analyzed to evaluate which have direct impact on the goals identified. A priority list of processes to be improved is then derived
<br>·	Analyze effectiveness measurements
<br>·	Analyze the risks in not achieving improvement goals. The impact of failing to achieve improvement goals is evaluated in order to understand the urgency and to set the priority of initiatives
<br>·	Analyze risks of improvement action failure. The potential risks of failure of an improvement action is analyzed to support the definition of priorities and to assure commitment and organizational support
<br>·	List improvement areas. A prioritized list of improvement areas is provided as a result of analyzing all the factors listed above
<br>·	Define specific improvement goals and set targets. Targets for improvement should be quantified for each priority area
<br>·	Derive an action plan. A set of actions to improve processes should be developed. Care should be taken to select a set of actions, which support each other in achieving the complete set of goals and targets. It is desirable also to include some improvement actions, which yield clear short-term benefits in order to encourage acceptance of the process improvement program.
</td></tr><tr><td><b>
Step 5 - Implement Improvements
</b></td></tr><tr><td>
A process improvement action plan is implemented in order to improve the process. Implementation may be simple or complex depending on the contents of the action plan and the characteristics of the organization.
In practice, several process improvement projects will be initiated, each concerned with implementing one or more process improvement actions. Such projects will often not cover only initial implementation of improvements. Four main tasks are involved in each process improvement project.
Operational approach to implementation - Where there are alternative operational approaches to implementation, they should be evaluated and the most suitable selected. It may be possible to implement in small steps through piloting in a selected unit or throughout the whole organization at the same time, or somewhere between these two extremes. </p><p>Among the factors to consider are costs, time scales, and risks.
Detailed implementation planning - A detailed implementation plan is then developed. The process improvement project may need to carry out a deeper analysis of improvement opportunities than that already carried out. Those implementing the actions and those affected by them should be involved, or be consulted, in developing the plan and in evaluating alternatives, in order to draw both on their expertise and enlist their cooperation.
Implementing improvement actions - During this activity, it is critical for successful improvement we take human and cultural factors into account.
Monitoring the process improvement project - Management should monitor the process improvement project against the process improvement project plan . Records should be kept to both confirm the improvements, and to improve the process of process improvement.
</td></tr><tr><td><b>

Step 6 - Confirm Improvements
</b></td></tr><tr><td>
Management as well as stakeholders must be involved to approve the results and to evaluate whether the organization's needs have been met. If, after improvement actions have been taken, measurements show that process goals and improvement targets have not been achieved, it may be desirable to redefine the project or activity by returning to an appropriate earlier step.
<br>·	Improvement targets - Current measurements of process effectiveness should be used to confirm achievement of process effectiveness targets. The possibility of having introduced desirable or undesirable side effects should be investigated. A further process assessment should be used to confirm achievement of targets expressed as process capability levels. Where several improvement projects were undertaken, however, consideration should be given to a reassessment of wider scope to check for potential side effects arising from the parallel improvement actions.
<br>·	Organizational culture - The effect of the improvements on organizational culture should be reviewed to establish that desired changes have taken place without undesirable side effects.
<br>·	Reevaluate risks - The organization should reevaluate the risks of using the improved process to confirm that they remain acceptable, and if they are not, determine what further actions are required.
<br>·	Reevaluate cost-benefit - The costs and benefits of the improvements may be reevaluated and compared with earlier estimates made. These results are useful to support planning of subsequent improvement actions.
</td></tr><tr><td><b>
Step 7 - Sustain Improvement Gains
</b></td></tr><tr><td>
After improvement has been confirmed, the process needs to be sustained at the new level of performance. This requires management to monitor institutionalization of the improved process and to give encouragement when necessary. Responsibilities for monitoring should be defined, as well as how this will be done by using appropriate effectiveness measurements.
If an improved process has been piloted in a restricted area or on a specific project or group of projects, it should be deployed across all areas or projects in the organization where it is applicable. This deployment should be properly planned and the necessary resources assigned to it. The plan should be documented as part of the process improvement project plan or the process improvement program plan as appropriate.
</td></tr><tr><td><b>
Step 8 - Monitor Performance
</b></td></tr><tr><td>
The performance of the process should be continuously monitored. New process improvement projects should be selected and implemented as part of a continuing process improvement program, since additional improvements are always possible.
<br>·	Monitoring performance of the process - The performance of the process should be monitored as it evolves over time. The effectiveness and conformance measures used for this should be chosen to suit the organization's needs and business goals, and should be regularly reviewed for continuing suitability. The risks to the organization and its products from using the process should also be monitored and action taken as risks materializes or become unacceptable.
<br>·	Reviewing the process improvement program - Management should review the process improvement program regularly. Further process assessments can be an important component of the continuing improvement program. The extent to which improved processes have been institutionalized should be considered before scheduling further process assessments. It may be more cost-effective to delay assessing a process until improvements have been fully deployed, rather than expend resources assessing a process, which is in transition, when the results can be difficult to interpret.
The bottom line of assessment is making application system testing more effective. This is performed by a careful analysis of the results of testing, and then taking action to correct identified weaknesses. Facts precede action, and testing in many organizations has suffered from the lack of facts. Once those facts have been determined, action should be taken.
The "measurement first, action second" concept is effective when the measurement process is specific. Measurement must be able to determine the effect of action. For example, the metric approach fulfills this requirement in that it shows very specific relationships. </p><p>Using this concept, if action is taken by changing one of the metric variables, the result of that action can be quickly measured.
Changing the variable in one metric can normally be measured by the change in another metric. For example, if the number of defects detected after the system goes operational is higher than desirable, then action should be taken. The action taken might be to increase the number of instructions exercised during testing. Obviously, this increases test cost with the hopeful objective of reducing undetected defects prior to operation.
It can be shown that increasing the number of instructions is considered desirable and should be extended. On the other hand, if increasing the number of instructions executed does not reduce the number of defects undetected prior to production, then those resources have not been used effectively and that action should be eliminated and another action tried.
Using the measurement/action approach, the variables can be manipulated until the desired result is achieved. Without the measurement, management can never be sure that intuitive or judgmental actions are effective. The measurement/action approach works and should be followed to improve the test process.
</td></tr><tr><td><b>
What is Quality?
</b></td></tr><tr><td>
The concept of quality establishes the foundation for an understanding of continuous process improvement. Although there are multiple quality philosophies documented it is important to note that most contain the same core philosophy: quality is based upon customer satisfaction. An organization must define quality before it can be achieved, and management must lead the organization through any improvement efforts.
There are two generally accepted definitions of quality and both are important:
<br>·	Meeting requirements
<br>·	Fitness for use
These two definitions are not inconsistent with each other.. Meeting requirements is a producer's definition of quality. It means that the person building the product builds it in accordance with requirements available to him or her. This is where most organizations have problems today. We cannot rely on the customer to tell us exactly what their requirements are since most customers have not been trained in how to document them. Requirements will be discussed later in this course.
The "fit for use" definition of quality is a consumer's version of quality. It means that the product produced meets the consumer's needs regardless of the product requirements. In other words, a programmer might write a program based on a customers requirements but the customer says he or she is still not happy.
It is the multiple definitions of quality that cause confusion about what quality is or is not! Thus we have quality gaps in our organization. An organization's quality policy must define and view quality from their customer's perspectives. If there are conflicts, they must be resolved.
Like peaks and valleys of mountains, the differences between what the software producer believes is a quality product ("met the requirements") and what the end user or customer believes ("You met my requirements but I'm not happy with the end result") are just as diverse, and sometimes, overwhelming. We call these differences of opinion the "Quality gaps".

Figure 1-1 - Quality Gaps
</td></tr><tr><td><b>
Quality Gaps
</b><</td></tr><tr><td>
Quality must be defined in terms of what it means to your organization. Essentially, Quality means meeting customer needs - in other words, a defect free product from both the viewpoint of the customer and the producer. Both Quality Assurance and Quality Control are used to make quality a reality. . Of the two quality assurance is the most important. Why? Because quality assurance is the activity where processes that produce the products are established and evaluated. These processes help deliver a quality product. Quality Assurance is "preventative" whereas Quality Control is "detective". QA establishes the processes by which products are developed and delivered. Sound processes that are easily improved, repeatable, well defined, and consistent, will help ensure that good products (whether software or widgets) are produced.
Quality is an attribute of a product. A product is something produced. In information technology, we produce requirement documents, test data, source code, load modules, terminal screens, and so forth. In addition, we perform a variety of services such as meetings with customers, reviewing help desk activities, providing training sessions, etc. Services are a form of products. In other words, there are quality attributes of services; so, for example, an agenda might be a quality attribute of a meeting.
Quality is achieved through processes. Good processes can consistently replicate a product. Even if a product or service is one-of-a-kind, (as often occurs in information technology projects), sound processes are able to replicate similar products with the same quality characteristics.
</td></tr><tr><td><b>
Understanding Quality
</b></td></tr><tr><td>
Quality is frequently defined as meeting the customer's requirements the first time and every time. Quality is also defined as conformance to a set of customer requirements that, if met, result in a product that is fit for its intended use.
Quality is much more than the absence of defects. Quality can only be achieved by the continuous improvement of all systems and processes in the organization, not only the production of products and services but also the design, development, servicing, purchasing, administration, and all aspects of the transaction with the customer. All must work together toward the same end.
Quality can only be seen through the eyes of the customers. An understanding of the customer's expectations (effectiveness) is the first step; then exceeding those expectations (efficiency) is required. Communication will be the key.
</td></tr><tr><td><b>
What is Excellence?
</b></td></tr><tr><td>
The Random House College Dictionary defines excellence as "superiority; eminence." Excellence, then, is a measure or degree of quality. These definitions of quality and excellence are important because they are a starting point for any management team contemplating the implementation of a quality policy. They must agree on a definition of quality and the degree of excellence they want to achieve and from this a company quality policy can be defined.
The Customer is King!
The common thread that runs through today's quality improvement efforts is the focus on the customer and, more importantly, customer satisfaction. The customer is the most important person in any process. Customers may be either internal or external. The question of customer satisfaction (whether that customer is located in the next work station, building, or across the globe) is the essence of a quality product. Identifying customers' needs in the areas of what, when, why, and how is an essential part of process evaluation and may be accomplished only through communications with the customers.
External customers are those using the products or services provided by the organization. Organizations need to identify and understand their customers in order to understand their expectations.
The internal customer is the person or group that receives the results (outputs) of any individual's work. The outputs may include a product, a report, a directive, a communication, or a service. In fact, this includes anything that is passed between people or groups. Customers include peers, subordinates, supervisors and other units within the organization. Their expectations must also be taken into account in the overall picture of organizational quality.

Why Quality?
</b></td></tr><tr><td>
Quality is the single most important factor affecting an organization's long-term performance. Dr. W. Edwards Deming (see Bibliography) has stated repeatedly that quality improves productivity, which leads to an improved competitive position and ensures that the organization will stay in business. In essence improved quality means more jobs and job security. Experience with Information Technology groups indicates that they are also in competition with other organizations such as outsourcers for business. . There also has been pressure on Information Technology groups to do more with less. Quality, then, is the way to achieve improved productivity and competitiveness in any organizati

Cost of Poor Quality
</b></td></tr><tr><td>
The cost of poor quality has been quoted by various sources as being between 15 percent and 50 percent of the cost of doing business. Studies have shown that the cost of poor quality may be as high as 20 percent of gross sales for manufacturing and 30 percent of gross sales for the service sector. Poor quality costs any organization many of its scarce dollars. One of the most effective actions management can take to improve productivity in any organization is to improve the quality of its processes. Quality is the solution to a problem; it is not the problem. Reducing the cost of poor quality directly affects the bottom line. Improving quality is the most direct way for an organization to increase profit.

<br>13.	Encourage education and self-improvement for everyone.
<br>14.	Take action to accomplish the transformation.
<br>Dr. Deming's philosophy is expressed in his Seven Deadly Management Diseases and his Fourteen Points. At first glance his philosophy seems simple, requiring nothing but common sense. And it is not complex. What is complex is its successful application. The important question is, "How do you follow these common-sense principles?" Understanding the Fourteen Points, agreeing to their meaning for your organization, and deciding how to implement them, is a necessary management responsibility which should follow management's defining quality and excellence. Notice the important, dominant role played by management in Deming's quest to improve organizations and their quality. Experience shows that employees will be skeptical of management's intent to adopt this philosophy. Only management commitment, demonstrated by new behavior, can hope to overcome their skepticism.
QAI believes that the theory behind the Fourteen Points is that management should be focused on improvement of processes instead of being focused on judgment of results. Management may struggle with the applicability of Deming's principles to their organization but this self-discovery builds the foundation for the implementation of continuous process improvement. This struggle cannot be delegated. Management must develop and communicate its quality philosophy to the entire organization.

Other Quality Philosophies
</b></td></tr><tr><td>
Thoughts and ideas from Dr. Joseph Juran, Philip Crosby, and Dr. Feigenbaum are also found in approaches to Total Quality Management (TQM). Juran's Ten Steps to Quality Improvement focus on the need to build awareness, set goals, organize, train, report progress, recognize, communicate, keep score, strive for breakthrough, and institutionalize. QAI stresses management commitment, as does Crosby in his first step to quality improvement. But QAI does not recommend a "zero defects" program (or any other programs since they do not lead to continuous improvement).
The Scientific Method
The scientific method combines a proven, logical approach to problem solving and process improvement with sound statistical techniques. While the scientific method has been around for ages, it has not been used extensively throughout most organizations. Curiously enough, even engineering organizations rarely use it to the extent demanded for quality improvement. The scientific method uses a logical, systematic approach on processes, not projects or problems.
</td></tr><tr><td><b>
Employee Involvement
</b></td></tr><tr><td>
Employee involvement is another cornerstone of any quality program. Teams are the device used to assure communication and cooperation between management and the rest of the employees. Through teams, all employees will be allowed to participate and contribute to the improvement of processes. Employees will be asked to share the responsibility for innovation and quality. What is an organization if it isn't functioning as a team? It is probably inefficient, ineffective, and not satisfying its customers.

Cost of Quality
</b></td></tr><tr><td>
When calculating the total production costs associated with the development of a new application or system, two cost components must be considered.
The first component consists of costs associated with producing the product "Right The First time," or RTF costs. These costs include labor, materials, and tools associated with the actual development of the application. Cost of Quality is a term that is used to quantify the total cost of failure, appraisal, and prevention costs associated with the production of software.
The second component includes the additional costs associated with assuring that the product delivered meets the quality goals established for the product. This cost component is called the Cost of Quality, and includes all costs associated with the prevention, identification, and correction of product defects.
The three categories of costs associated with producing quality products are:
<br>·	Prevention costs - Money required to prevent errors and to do the job right the first time. These normally require up-front costs for benefits that will be derived months or even years later. This category includes money spent on establishing methods and procedures, training workers, acquiring tools, and planning for quality. Prevention money is all spent before the product is actually built.
<br>·	Appraisal costs - Money spent to review completed products against requirements. Appraisal includes the cost of inspections, testing, and reviews. This money is spent after the product is built but before it is shipped to the user or moved into production.
<br>·	Failure costs - All costs associated with defective products that have been delivered to the user or moved into production. Some failure costs involve repairing products to make them meet requirements. Others are costs generated by failures such as the cost of operating faulty products, damage incurred by using them, and the costs associated with operating a Help Desk.
The cost of quality will vary from one organization to the next. The majority of costs associated with the Cost of Quality are associated with the identification and correction of defects. To minimize production costs, the project team must focus on defect prevention. The goal is to optimize the production process to the extent that rework is eliminated and inspection is built into the production process.
The IT quality assurance group must identify the costs within these three categories, quantify them, and then develop programs to minimize the totality of these three costs. Applying the concepts of continuous testing to the systems development process can reduce the cost of quality.

Quality Assurance is an activity that establishes and evaluates the processes which produce the products. If there is no process, there is no role for Quality Assurance.

Once installed, Quality Assurance measures the processes to find weaknesses and then takes steps to correct those weaknesses thereby continually improving the processes.

Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) - A planned and systematic pattern of all actions necessary to provide adequate confidence that an item or product conforms to establish technical requirements.
Microsoft's Jim McCarthy - Continually assess the state of the product, so the rest of the team can be focused on development.
Handbook of Software Quality Assurance (SQA) - The set of systematic activities providing evidence of the ability of the software process to produce a software product that is fit to use.
Bill Perry of the Quality Assurance Institute - QA begins with the definition of quality standards, methodology, and procedures; in other words, bringing order and control to the environment.

Impediments to Quality Assurance:
</b></td></tr><tr><td>
<br>·	Processes become obsolete - Many of us at one time or another have had processes to guide us in doing our job. When those processes are not updated or improved upon, they become obsolete.
<br>·	Management does not insist on compliance to processes - In an immature organization, we tend to act on "fires of the week" as the most critical items. That means we ignore the root cause those fires. Over time management ignores that they are even there.
<br>·	Workers are not convinced of the value of processes - Because management thinks short term, they focus on what is the Return of Investment (ROI) for the company in the immediate future. Processes take time to put into place and management is not willing to commit the resources necessary to accomplish the task.
<br>·	Processes are difficult to use and are not measurable - We do not fully understand what a measure is or metrics.
<br>·	Workers lack training in processes - many workers don't know how processes are developed so they need training on how to do it
<br>·	Processes do not focus on critical aspects of products - because we put out fires rather then focus on "Critical Success Factors."
<br>·	Measurement can threaten employees - An immature company may run on figures alone. To compensate for poor quality a company may set "quotas," for each department upon which to improve. If the "quotas" of improvement are not met, then management can use those figures as a means of

Quality Control (QC)
</b></td></tr><tr><td>
Quality Control is an activity that verifies whether or not the product produced meets standards for that product. In our example of a quality meeting, we said one attribute would be an agenda. Quality control would be that activity which asks for each meeting: "Is there an agenda?"

The following are industry-wide definitions of quality control you might encounter:
Dr. Joseph Juran - The regulatory process through which we measure actual quality performance, compare it with standards, and act on the differences.
Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) - This term has no standardized meaning in software engineering at this time. Use: a set of activities designed to evaluate the quality of developed or manufactured products.
Fisher Light - (Deficiencies of Software Quality Management) QC is the assessment of procedural and product compliance. Independently finding these deficiencies and correcting them assures compliance of the product with stated requirements.
Handbook of Software Quality Assurance (SQA) - The independent evaluation of the ability of the software process to produce a usable software product.
Impediments to Quality Control:
<br>·	Often viewed as a police action - In most cases, all QC has been initially viewed as the final 'gate' before shipment. The product had to be good enough to pass the final tests, and that frequently put QC in the role of production or shipment stopper. Thus the black hat or 'cop' impression.
<br>·	Unclear or ineffective standards and processes - Too often, QC or QA imposes standards or procedures that are not reviewed by those who have to follow them. This creates an 'ivory tower' impression of the quality folks. All standards and procedures must be, at least, reviewed by those who have to follow them. Ideally, the standards and procedures are actually written by the followers and reviewed by quality control.
<br>·	Information technology is often considered an art - There is no known cure for this disease, but we are still doing research to find one. If we can instill an engineering or scientific thought process into budding IT practitioners, we will come a long way to showing them that IT is a discipline like any other, and while standards and procedures are channeled through processes, they do not stifle creativity.
<br>·	Lack of training on processes - This, unlike the previous statement is eminently curable. The need for training and education is easily satisfied if management can be made to see the value, and there is ample evidence of the value.
</td></tr><tr><td><b>
Why are they impediments to QC?
</b></td></tr><tr><td>
It has something to do with the "brain drain" that occurs when a strong IT practitioner is made a manager and is given non-technical goals and responsibilities. That is, they now have to meet budget and schedule goals that they would not have agreed to as a practitioner. As they gain 'time in grade' as a boss, they tend to lose the hard-won understanding of the realities of IT and see only the bottom line and overhead costs of quality, rather than the value-added characteristics.
Can you think of a few more? Clearly the greatest impediment to quality practice is the perceived cost. We spend many dollars today and are given vague and unproven (within our organization) promises of huge returns in the future. We must help develop programs to be given to mid-managers who show the values he or she can actually expect to gain from a robust quality program. The big guys already know, and the little guys find it very easy to say "we're too small to be able to incur those costs."

Differentiating Control From Assurance
</b></td></tr><tr><td>
<br>·	Quality control relates to a specific product or service - QA is focused on the process
<br>·	Quality control verifies whether specific attribute(s) are in or not part of a specific product or service
<br>·	Quality control identifies defects for the primary purpose of correcting defects
<br>·	Quality control is the responsibility of the worker
<br>·	Quality assurance helps establish processes
<br>·	Quality assurance sets up measurement programs to evaluate processes
<br>·	Quality assurance identifies weaknesses in processes and improves them
<br>·	Quality assurance is a management responsibility, frequently performed by a staff function
<br>·	Quality assurance evaluates whether or not quality control is working for the primary purpose of determining whether or not there is a weakness in the process
<br>·	Quality control is concerned with a specific product
<br>·	Quality assurance is concerned with all the products that will ever be produced by a process
<br>·	Quality assurance is sometimes called quality control over quality control because it evaluates whether quality control is working
<br>·	Quality assurance personnel should never perform quality control unless doing it to validate that quality control is working
